    "Your team at EngageMetrics, a leading employee engagement analytics company, has just received datasets from multiple sources that need to be consolidated for an urgent executive presentation. The data includes employee feedback from regional offices in CSV format, educational achievement records in Excel spreadsheets, and compensation benchmarks from an external API. The leadership team needs insights on employee engagement trends by tomorrow morning.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll learn how to efficiently import and process this scattered data using Python. You'll work with real EngageMetrics datasets containing employee insights, educational records, and external market data, mastering the essential data import techniques needed to handle various file formats and common data challenges.\n",
