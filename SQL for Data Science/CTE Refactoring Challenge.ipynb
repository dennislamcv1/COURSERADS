    "In this lab, you'll explore the realm of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and refactoring complex queries. As a data analyst at BookCycle, you'll work on improving the readability and performance of a multi-step query. This lab will help you understand the power of CTEs in simplifying complex SQL queries and preparing you for real-world data analysis challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Learning Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Identify complex, multi-step queries that can benefit from refactoring\n",
    "- Apply CTEs to simplify and improve query readability\n",
    "- Compare your refactored query with AI-generated suggestions\n",
    "- Evaluate query performance and readability improvements\n",
